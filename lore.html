                    <h1>Dark Souls</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <img alt="lore" src="screenshots/lore/ds.jpg">
                    <p>Dark Souls is not a game for the faint-hearted thanks to its challenging difficulty, but if you're able to best its gameplay, then you will have the opportunity to try and decipher some of its lore. The series offers players little in the way of exposition, but that doesn't mean the lore isn't there. It just demands that you meet it on its terms. The Dark Souls lore can be discovered by observing its meticulously crafted world, which is littered with the scars of the past. You will also glean a number of details from the people you meet during your travels. And then, of course, there are the items.</p>
                    <p>A great deal of thought was put into the description of the various items you will encounter during your quest. This means that there are endless bits of lore that you could easily miss just by not picking up certain items in the game. Fortunately, the Dark Souls fanbase is incredibly active and has done an amazing job of deciphering and documenting the lore of the games. So even if the idea of playing games as hard as these puts you off, you can still learn the secrets of this intricate fantasy world.</p>

                    <h1>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <img alt="lore" src="screenshots/lore/es.jpg">
                    <p>Nothing compares to the sheer amount of content created by Bethesda in its most well-known series of all: The Elder Scrolls. The fact that the team at Bethesda has written hundreds of actual in-game books for players to read while they play practically any Elder Scrolls title, should tell you everything you need to know about the depth of the lore that surrounds this series.</p>
                    <p>Even Skyrim's lore alone would be enough to place the series on this list â€” such is the depth of this franchise. With five installments in the main series, with each exploring different areas and aspects of the universe, there is seemingly no end to the content players have available to them. Every race has a deep history, even those you (almost) never see in the games, such as the Dwemer. So if you want something accessible, but containing vast amounts of lore, look no further than Bethesda's most famous series.</p>

                    <h1>Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <img alt="lore" src="screenshots/lore/mgspp.jpg">
                    <p>The Metal Gear Solid franchise is best known for its emphasis on stealth rather than aggressive combat. In its fifth installment, Snake's primary mission is to get his well-deserved revenge after the events that took place in the prologue, Ground Zero.</p>
                    <p>While the MGS universe isn't similarly heavy as a fantasy medieval RPG game world would be, it makes its mark as one of the most detailed and immersive worlds in gaming history thanks to its well-defined characters and long history.</p>

                    <h1>The Legend of Zelda</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <img alt="lore" src="screenshots/lore/loz.jpg">
                    <p>The Legend of Zelda is a series well worth diving into if you like the idea of trying to wrap your head around multiple diverging timelines. With the first game having released all the way back in 1986 on the NES, there's a truly massive amount of content for you to indulge in.</p>
                    <p>With the various iterations of the heroes of the Triforce and their conflicts to explore, along with Hyrule and the many other lands you visit in the games, you'll be working for days trying to get your head around even the simplest version of the timelines.</p>

                    <h1>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <img alt="lore" src="screenshots/lore/twwh.jpg">
                    <p>While Skyrim is definitely one of the best and most immersive open-world games out there due to the amount of lore it has, it easily loses to CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Where Skyrim fails miserably to keep the player engaged, The Witcher 3 excels.</p>
                    <p>The Witcher 3 has easily the richest world out there, not only thanks to the efforts of the developers to include Polish mythology and politics of the medieval fantasy world in the game, but also because it's based on a series of highly successful books. Unique and special, The Witcher 3 is ideal for any lore-hungry gamers who dream of exploring a vibrant open-world setting.</p>
